The DJ algorithm is considered to be the first quantum algorithm that provides speedup over its classical counterpart.  
It is the generilization of the deutsch algorithm which could only perform operation for one qubit. 
For a classical computer to know whether a function is balanced or constant with zero error it takes 2^n+1 queries of the oracle function.
DJ algortihm does this one single query which is exponential speed up. 
However, it provides no speedup to bounded error probabilistic classical algorithm.
Fun fact: my nickname is DJ.
